# Python-Learning
# 🐍 Python Practice Repository

This repository contains my Python learning journey.  
I’m practicing Python step by step — from **foundations** to **intermediate concepts**, and later moving towards **projects**.

## 📂 Folder Structure

### 1. Foundation Python
Basic programs to build core concepts:
- `01.py` → Print, variables, operators  
- `02.py` → Strings and input/output  
- `03.py` → Lists and tuples  
- `04.py` → Sets and dictionaries  
- `05.py` → Conditional statements  
- `06.py` → Loops  
- `GPT practice.py` → Extra practice examples  

### 2. Intermediate Python
- `class.py` → Classes and objects  
- `inheritance.py` → Inheritance concepts  
- `file.py` → File handling (read/write)  
- `practice_class.py` → Class practice examples  
- `project/` → Small projects (will grow over time)  

### 3. Notes
- `text.txt`, `this_copy.txt`, `Renamed_python.txt` → Random practice notes
